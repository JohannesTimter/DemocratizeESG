Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use.

Carbon credits can be sold off as well: If the company sold more credits than it has bought, use the negative carbon credit balance as a value here.\n      The company needs to have purchased carbon credits or performed carbon offset within the reporting year.\n      \n      Suggested search words (you should still come up with your own search terms):\n      Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), carbon credit, OFFSETS, Offsets \u2013 all GHGs \n      \n      Response Requirements:\n      -You are only allowed to return a single json object in your response, you can never return multiple results.      \n      Example Output:\n      {            \n            \"is_disclosed\": 1, //If the Information we are looking for is not disclosed in the document, set the is_disclosed field to 0.\n            \"indicator_id\": \"carbon_credits_offsets\":,\n            \"value\": \"1.1 \",\n            \"unit\": \"million tonnes of co2e\",\n            \"page_number\": \"92\", //page number, where the respective information was found.\n            \"section\": \"In 2024, SSAB bought 2.3 million tonnes of emission rights and sold 1.2 million tonnes.\" //text section where you found the information.\n      }\n\n      General instructions:\n      -Use the provided document as a source of metrics\n      -Only consider english text\n      -You are much better at reading tables and text than at interpreting figures.

The plans are to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces. This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period.

Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use.

This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period.

This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period.

This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period.

Carbon credits can be sold off as well: If the company sold more credits than it has bought, use the negative carbon credit balance as a value here.\n      The company needs to have purchased carbon credits or performed carbon offset within the reporting year.\n      \n      Suggested search words (you should still come up with your own search terms):\n      Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), carbon credit, OFFSETS, Offsets \u2013 all GHGs \n      \n      Response Requirements:\n      -You are only allowed to return a single json object in your response, you can never return multiple results.      \n      Example Output:\n      {            \n            \"is_disclosed\": 1, //If the Information we are looking for is not disclosed in the document, set the is_disclosed field to 0.\n            \"indicator_id\": \"carbon_credits_offsets\":,\n            \"value\": \"1.1 \",\n            \"unit\": \"million tonnes of co2e\",\n            \"page_number\": \"92\", //page number, where the respective information was found.\n            \"section\": \"In 2024, SSAB bought 2.3 million tonnes of emission rights and sold 1.2 million tonnes.\" //text section where you found the information.\n      }\n\n      General instructions:\n      -Use the provided document as a source of metrics\n      -Only consider english text\n      -You are much better at reading tables and text than at interpreting figures.

This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period.

Around 90% of SSAB\u2019s direct carbon dioxide emissions are derived from the total of five blast furnaces in Nordic steelmaking. The plans are to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces. This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period. SSAB assesses that the reduction of Scope 1 emissions will meet the emission reduction target for both Scope 1 and Scope 2 combined.

This makes the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking with the decommissioning of blast furnaces and coke plants alike the main activities to reach the climate targets (see E1-4). The remaining 10% of direct emissions originate from fossil fuels and will be reduced by process electrification and by using fossil-free fuels like biogas. Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), primarily electricity, will be relatively neutral in relation to emission targets set. Transitioning to fossil-free electricity will reduce the emission intensity of the electricity used but at the same time, the phase-out of fossil-free fuels through electrification will increase electricity use. Overall, it is assessed that these will largely cancel each other out during the actual target period.
