I've focused my search on environmental investments, CapEx, OpEx, and importantly, EU Taxonomy alignment.\\n\\nI began by searching the document for key terms like \\\"environmental purposes,\\\" \\\"CapEx,\\\" \\\"OpEx,\\\" and \\\"taxonomy.\\\" I systematically reviewed the document, meticulously noting any mention of environmental spending or investments. The instructions are specific: exclude carbon credits and offsets, as those have their own indicator. I'm looking for *explicit* environmental CapEx and OpEx, particularly those aligned with the EU Taxonomy, starting from 2024.\\n\\nEarly sections (Pages 4, 6, 8, 13, 14) discussed general investments and financial frameworks, but nothing specific to environmental CapEx or OpEx was found. Page 15 mentioned ESG considerations, but without monetary figures. Page 16 mentions carbon-offsetting expenses (excluded) and SAF, but doesn't quantify them separately from offsets. Page 23 details climate strategies, including fleet modernization (potentially CapEx), but no monetary values are provided. Pages 41 and 42 present a \\\"Financial contribution from Business to Business (B2B) Offsets and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programs\\\" totaling $4.3 million. However, the instruction explicitly excludes carbon offsets. Since SAF is bundled with offsets, and the document doesn't provide a way to separate the SAF portion, I can't use this value.  Pages 42 and 43 reiterate the programs without providing disaggregated monetary values, and Page 75 discusses climate change impacts and capital expenditure for more fuel-efficient aircraft without separating out the environmental portion.\\n\\nThe key missing element is any explicit EU Taxonomy alignment. Despite being a 2024 annual report, the document does not mention \\\"EU Taxonomy\\\" or taxonomy-aligned spending. Given the instructions and the document's structure, I would expect to find such information if it were disclosed.\\n\\nMy conclusion: based on this thorough review, the required information appears to be not disclosed in the provided document. Therefore, `isDisclosed` should be set to 0.\\n\"\n",

      "              \"text\": \"**Quantifying Low-Carbon Revenue for Qantas Airways in 2024**\\n\\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking as I navigated this document. My task was to isolate the \\\"Total revenue from products/services designed for low-carbon economy\\\" for Qantas Airways for the fiscal year 2024. I was focused on keywords like \\\"low-carbon,\\\" \\\"sustainable,\\\" and any financial metrics related to these areas.\\n\\nMy initial scan through the document (pages 3-24) was mostly fruitless. While there was plenty of discussion about sustainability initiatives, climate action plans, and fleet efficiency, direct revenue figures for low-carbon products or services were absent. I noted the mention of the Airbus A220's fuel efficiency, but that was about operational improvements, not revenue generation. I went through the financial highlights and the Group Underlying Income Statement Summary, but total revenue was listed, with no breakdown. Similarly, the MATERIAL BUSINESS RISKS section covered climate-related risks, but again, no specific revenue figures were present.\\n\\nMy breakthrough came on page 41 and, specifically, page 42, within the \\\"Performance Assessment of 2023/24 Group Scorecard Measures - Climate\\\" section. Here, I found a clear statement: \\\"The SAF Corporate Coalition achieved revenue of $3.3 million.\\\" This was explicitly labeled as *revenue* generated from the SAF Corporate Coalition, which aligns perfectly with my criteria of revenue from low-carbon related activity. The document describes it as a business-to-business product.\\n\\nWhile I saw a broader \\\"total program mitigations\\\" value of $4.3 million (which included other elements like the \\\"Qantas Future Planet program\\\"), the explicit revenue from the SAF Corporate Coalition of $3.3 million was the most direct and accurate answer to the specific prompt. It's revenue generated by the reporting company.\\n\\nTherefore, my final determination is: **$3.3 million** is the \\\"lowCarbon_revenue\\\" I was looking for, found on page 42, within the \\\"Performance Assessment of 2023/24 Group Scorecard Measures - Climate\\\" section.\\n\"\n",

Let's see...\\n\\nI've quickly scanned the document and it looks like Page 5 has a \\\"Five-Year History\\\" table with \\\"Revenue and other income.\\\" Hmm, possibly a good starting point. Page 13 mentions the \\\"financial year 2023/24,\\\" which is a close match, so I'll keep an eye on that. Page 16 looks interesting with a \\\"Group Underlying Income Statement Summary\\\" table; it shows \\\"Revenue\\\" for June 2024. Pages 19, 20, and 21 have \\\"Revenue\\\" broken down by Qantas Domestic, International, Jetstar, and Loyalty. Finally, Page 68 has a \\\"Consolidated Income Statement\\\" with \\\"Revenue and other income\\\" for both 2024 and 2023. This is what I was hoping to find!\\n\\nNow, looking closer at Page 68's \\\"Consolidated Income Statement,\\\" the \\\"Revenue and other income\\\" for 2024 is listed as \\\"21,939\\\" $M. That seems to be the total group revenue. Excellent! The reporting period is \\\"For the year ended 30 June 2024,\\\" which matches perfectly.\\n\\nI'm checking if this value appears elsewhere to ensure consistency.  Looking back at Page 5, I confirm \\\"Revenue and other income\\\" for 2024 is the same \\\"21,939\\\" $M. And page 16 also confirms the value.\\n\\nSince it's consistent across multiple sections, I feel confident using the figure from the \\\"Consolidated Income Statement\\\" as it's the primary financial statement.\\n\\nThe value is indeed \\\"21,939\\\", and the units are millions (\\\"M\\\") of Australian Dollars (AUD). The document mentions \\\"Australian dollars\\\" on page 74 for good measure.\\n\\nSo, here's my answer: **AUD 21,939 million is the Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2024 (Page 68, Consolidated Income Statement).**\\n\"\n",

The user has specifically requested the group's consolidated figures, not the parent company's or subsidiary companies' financial reports.\\n\\nMy approach involved searching the document for variations of the target metric, such as \\\"Statutory Profit After Tax\\\" and \\\"Statutory profit for the year.\\\" I quickly located several promising entries.\\n\\nPage 4's \\\"Financial and Operational Highlights\\\" section immediately provided a key value: \\\"$1.25 billion Statutory Profit After Tax\\\" for FY24. Page 5's table of \\\"FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1\\\" for the \\\"Qantas Annual Report 2024\\\" reinforces this with a \\\"Statutory Profit/(Loss) After Tax\\\" of \\\"1,251 $M\\\" for 2024. Page 68, the \\\"Consolidated Income Statement,\\\" confirms this value, listing \\\"Statutory profit for the year\\\" as \\\"1,251 $M\\\" for the relevant year. Page 13's \\\"RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS\\\" aligns, stating \\\"Statutory Profit After Tax was $1,251 million.\\\"\\n\\nI've taken the instruction to use the group's values for this specific request into consideration. Page 106 and 109 provides the Parent entity and Deed of Cross Guarantee. However, these figures are for the parent and consolidated entity, respectively. Page 5, and 68 are the best fit for this scenario.\\n\\nThe term \\\"Statutory Profit After Tax\\\" generally encompasses net income after all taxes, including both continuing and discontinued operations, which aligns perfectly with the user's request for \\\"net income after taxes, not income from continuing operations.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, I have confirmed the value is \\\"1,251\\\", unit \\\"AUD millions\\\", and can be found on page \\\"68\\\" within the \\\"Consolidated Income Statement,\\\" specifically listed as \\\"Statutory profit for the year\\\" for the fiscal year 2024.
