      "\n",
      "Okay, I'm tasked with pinpointing the specific amount of Operational Expenditure (OpEx) and Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Qantas allocated to environmental purposes in 2024, focusing on EU Taxonomy alignment. This is a bit tricky, and I need to be precise.  The goal is clear: identify *only* money spent on environmental initiatives that align with the EU Taxonomy, explicitly excluding any investment in carbon credits and offsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "My initial search focused on terms like \"environmental purposes,\" \"OpEx environmental,\" \"CapEx environmental,\" \"EU Taxonomy aligned,\" and various related phrases. I immediately turned to the \"GROUP SCORECARD OUTCOME 2023/24\" on page 41, figuring it would be a likely source.  The \"Climate\" section caught my eye, particularly the mention of \"$4.3 million\" for \"B2B Offsets and SAF programs.\" However, the instructions were crystal clear: exclude anything related to carbon credits. This $4.3 million figure is a combined amount for both offsets and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).  Without a breakdown, I can't confidently isolate the SAF portion, which *would* be considered environmental expenditure. I have to discard this figure, unfortunately, as it's not specific enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I looked for other hints. Page 24, discussing climate change, mentioned investments in \"modern aircraft technology\" and supporting the SAF industry. Page 75 mentioned \"capital expenditure to introduce more fuel-efficient aircraft,\" which *could* be relevant. However, these discussions didn't give me specific financial figures directly related to 2024 that I could use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered combining figures, as the instructions suggested, but the report doesn't seem to break down OpEx and CapEx into specific environmental categories. I found general figures for net capital expenditure ($3,148 million), but this is the total, not just the environmentally focused portion. Page 16 mentions \"higher SAF and carbon-offsetting program expenses,\" again without separating them for 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge is finding data that meets *all* the requirements:  (1) It needs to be OpEx or CapEx; (2) it must be for environmental purposes; (3) it must be related to 2024; (4) it must be EU Taxonomy aligned (or similar); and (5) it *must* exclude carbon credits and offsets. While the report touches on these topics, it doesn't provide the level of detail needed to extract an exact figure that meets all criteria.  The Qantas report seems to emphasize the intent of these environmental activities, but not specific costs.\n",

I scrutinized the Annual Report for key phrases like \"low-carbon revenue,\" \"taxonomy aligned turnover,\" and \"revenue from products that enable sustainability.\"\n",

      "Alright, let's see. The user needs the revenue for Qantas Airways for 2024.  I need to find a table or section that clearly lays out that specific data.  I'm looking for terms like \"Revenue and other income,\" \"Net turnover,\" or just \"revenue.\"  Since this is a financial question, I'll naturally head towards the \"Financial Report,\" \"Financial and Operational Highlights,\" or a \"Five-Year History\" section if they have one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the table of contents, I see \"Financial Report\" starts on page 65, \"Five-Year History\" is on page 5, and the \"Financial and Operational Highlights\" are on page 2. I'll start with the \"Five-Year History\" since it's most likely to be a concise overview.\n",

      "To be extra sure, let me verify in the \"Financial Report.\" Page 68 has the \"Consolidated Income Statement,\" and there's a section \"REVENUE AND OTHER INCOME.\"  Checking, yep, \"Revenue and other income\" for 2024 is the same: 21,939 $M. Spot on.\n",

      "Alright, let's break this down. The request is for Qantas Airways' total full-time employee count for 2024. That means I'm looking for hard numbers, preferably for the company itself, but group figures will work in a pinch. The document might use terms like \"employees,\" \"workforce,\" \"headcount,\" or even break it down by department, so I'll need to be thorough. I'll focus on sections typically dealing with company metrics, HR disclosures, and the financial report. I'll prioritize tables and direct text over figures if I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Page-by-Page Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "I've gone through the document meticulously. First, the table of contents directs me to likely sections: \"Financial and Operational Highlights,\" \"Directors' Report,\" and anything sustainability- or workforce-related. The \"Financial and Operational Highlights\" section (page 4) proved to be financial numbers, not employee figures.  Page 5 contained general statistics.  Page 6's Chair's Message mentioned \"More than 29,000 employees across the Qantas Group as of FY2412\" which is from the prompt, but it's not actually in the document. Page 8 mentioned an *increase* of 2,000 employees, but not a total.  Pages 10-12, the Board of Directors, showed biographical information, no employee totals. I continued this systematic search through the \"Review of Operations\" (Pages 13-25), the \"Condensed Corporate Governance Statement\" (Pages 26-27), the \"Directors' Report\" (Pages 28-32), and the \"Remuneration Report\" (Pages 34-64), among others.  I looked at financial statements and associated notes from page 65 onwards. There were mentions of \"employees\" throughout, but never a hard, quantifiable number for 2024. I was especially diligent in checking the \"Salaries, wages, and other benefits\" (page 68) because that is a very common place to put headcount figures.\n",

      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, despite an exhaustive search, the exact number requested — the total number of full-time Qantas Airways employees (or the Qantas Group) for 2024—is not explicitly stated in this document. The document alludes to employees, their importance, and mentions of workforce in various ways, but a definitive headcount figure is missing. I also tried an exact search for \"More than 29,000 employees across the Qantas Group as of FY2412\", a suggested term, and the phrase is not in the document itself. I was hopeful for an early number on page 8 regarding the *increase* in employees but that didn't provide any useful information on the total count for 2024.\n",
